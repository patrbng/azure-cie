A few days after your first Azure virtual machine backup was completed, the server had issues and it needs to be restored from a backup. You want to restore the virtual machine's disk and attach it to the problematic live server, and then track the restore to ensure that it has completed successfully.

In this exercise, you'll see how to restore a successful backup to replace a VM that has become corrupted, and monitor its progress.

## Login to the Azure Portal

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in a browser.

2. Sign into Azure using the Microsoft account email address and password you created for this session.

2. Select **+ Add**, and then use the following information to create a storage account:

   **Resource Group**

    * Select **vmbackups**.

   **Storage account name**

    * Enter a unique name like **restorestagingYYYYMMDD**, where YYYYMMDD is replaced with today's date.

    **Location**

3. Select **Review + create**.

4. On the **Create storage account** page, select **Create**.

5. Wait for the storage account to be deployed.

### Stop the VM to allow for the restore

A backup can't be restored if the VM is allocated and running. If you forget to stop the VM, you'll see an error that is similar to the following example.

To prevent this error, use the following steps.

1. In the far left menu, select **Virtual machines**, and then select **test-win-vm1**.

### Restore the VM

The Recovery Services vaults are accessible at the subscription level. However, as you are already viewing the VM, Azure provides a quick link to the specific vault under **Operations**.

1. In the left menu, under **Operations**, select **Backup**.

4. In the **Restore Configuration** window, select **Replace Existing** and use the following information to configure the restore:

   **Restore Type**

    * Select **Replace Disk(s)**, this is the restore point that will be used to replace the existing VM's disks.

    **Staging Location**

    * Select the storage account you created previously.

## Track a restore

1. At the top of the page, select **View all Jobs**.

2. Select the restore job, you can now monitor the progress of the VM restore:

    * **Job Progress**: Real-time percentage of the job as a whole
    * **Sub Tasks**: Shows the status of the current task within the job

Congratulations! With a few steps, you restored a VM in Azure.
