You will need the **new Microsoft account email address and password from your previous lab**, to redeem the pass for an Azure credit, and to create and manage the subscription.

* **DO NOT** redeem a pass with an email account that is attached to an EA, the pass will not work.
* Passes needs to be redeemed within 90-days of being received.
* Customer Live ID/Org ID will be limited to one concurrent Azure Pass Sponsorship at a time.
* Monetary credit can't be used toward third party services, premier support or Azure MarketPlace and cannot be added to existing subscriptions.
* If you add a payment instrument to the subscription and the subscription is active at the conclusion of the offer it will be converted to Pay-As-You-Go.
* Subscriptions are activated within minutes of the pass being redeemed.
